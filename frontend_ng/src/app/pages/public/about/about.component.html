<p>This is project I put together in like 10 days for the Qloo Hackathon. I wanted to get some practice and show case my skills as a fullstack software engineer. I'm using the Qloo API under the hood for when you ask the chatbot for some kind of taste-based recommendations. I'm currently seeking new opportunities, so if you have any open, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/levon-ritter/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/levon-ritter/</a></p>
